Modelling Population Dynamics

March 2024

This group project involved Matlab coding and using mathematical and numerical methods to study the dynamics of a Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey dynamics. This included modelling the different populations through plotting graphs and contour maps which showed the conservation of the species and the maximum sustainable yield.
We also researched the limitations of our models and how to make them more realistic for managing this real world ecosystem.
This project also including creating a Latex report to present all our findings, graphs and research. 
Overall, this project scored 86% and contributed towards my final grade in the "Mathematical Modelling" module.
